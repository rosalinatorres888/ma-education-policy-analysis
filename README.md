## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

This project leverages **advanced machine learning techniques** and **interpretable AI** to analyze what makes Massachusetts the #1 state in education nationwide. Through comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and counterfactual modeling, I provide actionable policy recommendations with quantified ROI estimates.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Question
**How can strategic investment in education policy maximize both academic outcomes and economic returns?**

### ðŸ’¡ Core Findings
- Massachusetts outperforms the national average by **19 points** in 8th grade reading (NAEP 2024)
- **4.2x ROI** on early childhood education investment (highest confidence: 92%)
- Bachelor's degree attainment (45.7%) exceeds national average by **12 points**
- Comprehensive reform can improve scores by **15.6 points**
